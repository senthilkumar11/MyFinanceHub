# Sync Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Record Issue
- **Problem**: Sync was creating duplicate records instead of checking existing ones
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `getTransactionByCatalystRowId()` and `getBudgetByCatalystRowId()` methods to DAOs and Repositories
  - Modified `insertTransactionFromSync()` and `insertBudgetFromSync()` in ViewModels to check by `catalystRowId` instead of local `id`
  - Now properly updates existing records or inserts new ones based on ROWID from Catalyst

### 2. Removed Automatic Sync on App Start
- **Problem**: App was automatically syncing every time user logged in, causing unnecessary network calls
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed the `LaunchedEffect` sync logic from `MainActivity.kt`
  - App now starts faster without automatic background sync

### 3. Added Manual Sync Button in Profile Screen
- **Problem**: No way for users to manually trigger sync when needed
- **Solution**:
  - Added sync functionality to `ProfileScreen.kt`
  - Added visual sync status with loading indicator
  - Shows sync progress and completion status
  - Users can now manually sync data when they want to

### 4. Improved Pagination Logic
- **Features**:
  - Fixed limit syntax to use `limit(offset, count)` format as per SQL standard
  - Added batch processing methods (`fetchTransactionsBatch`, `fetchBudgetsBatch`)
  - Removed date-based filtering in favor of simple batch-by-batch processing
  - CREATEDTIME ordering ensures consistent data retrieval

## Database Schema Requirements

Make sure your Catalyst DataStore tables have these columns:
- `ROWID` (auto-generated by Catalyst)
- `CREATEDTIME` (auto-generated by Catalyst)
- All your custom fields (amount, type, category, etc.)

## Usage

1. **Manual Sync**: Go to Profile screen and tap "Sync Data"
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatic - records with same ROWID won't be duplicated
3. **Batch Processing**: Data is fetched in chunks of 100 records for better performance

## Technical Details

- **Sync Strategy**: Manual sync only (no automatic sync)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Uses `catalystRowId` field from Catalyst ROWID
- **Batch Size**: 100 records per request (configurable)
- **Order**: Most recent first (CREATEDTIME DESC)
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with Toast notifications
